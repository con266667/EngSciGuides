## Free Body Diagrams

To solve a truss, you will need to use the methods of structural analysis. This involves determining the forces acting on each member of the truss and using the equations of equilibrium to solve for the unknown forces. This can be a complex process, and it is usually best to work with a trained engineer or structural analyst to ensure that the solution is accurate. To begin solving a truss, you will need to first identify all of the forces acting on the structure, including external loads such as gravity and wind, as well as the forces between the members of the truss. You will then need to determine the direction and magnitude of each force, using free-body diagrams and the equations of equilibrium. Once you have determined the forces acting on the truss, you can use these forces to solve for the unknown forces within the truss. This is typically done using a matrix equation, which can be solved using a variety of methods, such as the method of joints or the method of sections.
